- In PostgresSql view is a virtual table that represents the result of a database query. A view is a stored query that is executed when the view is queried.
```sql
CREATE VIEW active_users AS
SELECT id, username, email
FROM users
WHERE is_active = TRUE;

SELECT * FROM active_users;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW active_users AS
SELECT id, username, email
FROM users
WHERE is_active = TRUE;

DROP VIEW active_users;
```
