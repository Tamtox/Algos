1. Factory Pattern - separates construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations. 
2. Abstract Factory Pattern - provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
3. Singleton Pattern - ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
