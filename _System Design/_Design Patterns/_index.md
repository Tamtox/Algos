Design Pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It is a template or description for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

There are 3 types of design patterns:
1. Creational Design Patterns - These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.
2. Structural Design Patterns - These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.
3. Behavioral Design Patterns - These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.


### Creational Design Patterns
- Singleton Pattern - Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- Factory Method Pattern - Defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- Abstract Factory Pattern - Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
