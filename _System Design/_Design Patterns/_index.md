Design Pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It is a template or description for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

There are 3 types of design patterns:
1. Creational Design Patterns - These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.
2. Structural Design Patterns - These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.
3. Behavioral Design Patterns - These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.


### Creational Design Patterns
1. Factory Pattern - separates construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations. 
2. Abstract Factory Pattern - provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
3. Singleton Pattern - ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
4. Prototype Pattern - creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.
5. Builder Pattern - constructs a complex object step by step, allowing the construction process to vary independently from the object being constructed.

### Structural Design Patterns
1. Adapter Pattern - used to bridge the gap between two incompatible interfaces.
2. Bridge Pattern - decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
3. Composite Pattern - composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
4. Decorator Pattern - adds new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure.
5. Facade Pattern - provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
