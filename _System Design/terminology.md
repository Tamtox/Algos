- ACID - A set of properties of database transactions: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.

- Cache - A component that stores data so future requests for that data can be served faster.

- CAP Theorem - A computer science theorem that states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

- CDN - Content Delivery Network is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users.

- Circuit Breaker - A design pattern used in modern software development to detect failures and encapsulate the logic of preventing a failure from constantly recurring, during maintenance, temporary external system failure, or unexpected system difficulties.

- Idempotent - An operation that has the same result no matter how many times it is called.

- Latency - The time it takes for a request to go from the client to the server and back.

- Load Balancer - Dividing the incoming network traffic among multiple servers so that no one server processes a large amount of load.

- Microservices - Architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.

- Pub/Sub - A messaging pattern where senders of messages (publishers) do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers (subscribers).

- Scalability - The ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work or its potential to accommodate growth.
  - Vertical Scaling - Increasing the capacity of a single machine, such as upgrading the CPU, RAM, or SSD.
  - Horizontal Scaling - Increasing the number of machines in the system, such as adding more servers to a pool.

- Sharding - A method for splitting and storing a single logical dataset in multiple databases.

- Throughput - The number of units of work that a system can handle per unit of time.
